# ProjectV1
first time using laravel and bootstrap and still in the process of being worked on, please try it yourself and I have noted how to run it


First open XAMPP v8.2 then run Apache and MySQL after that open chrome then type http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ in the browser address bar
then import the 'produk' database then open VSCode and run "php artisan serve" Terminal /** Short Key: Ctrl + Shift + ` */ and you want to see it you have to check first what calls to make then open the "routes/web.php" folder
. if you don't know how to run all this you can watch this youtube video
